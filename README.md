## Overview

This project aims to create a game engine for the development of accessible games, in particular games using text and (optional) audio as output mediums. The focus is on games simulating physical space, though not necessarily corresponding to the real world.

Currently this project is in the beginning stage, so don't expect much, but watch this space for updates.
